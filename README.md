**Pros for databases**

**1**. Since databases store information more efficiently, databases can handle more of the information that would be really hard to manage in a spreadsheet. Spreadsheets have record limitations whereas databases do not.

**2**. Editing information in databases is easier since its more easy to edit huge volumes of information at the same time without the need for modifyng the files by hand.

**3**. A database has very effective querying functions that could retrieve all of the records matching select criteria, cross-reference records in multiple tables.Thus databases provide a flexibility to sort and present data in a many ways that would be done by humans in spreadsheets.

**4**. It is much easier to accidentally  delete data in a spreadsheet than in a database.When the spreadsheet is larger and more complex there is a greater possibility that the data can accidentally be modified.

**Cons for databases**

**1**. Since spreadsheets dont require much training its easier for the employes to use and since in these modern times people know office programs widely most of the time spreadsheets doesnt require any traning at all.
